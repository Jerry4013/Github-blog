### Day 24: Forms

## Register the Form controls

To make Angular take over a form element, e.g. an Input, we need to add `ngModel` and a `name` for this input.

```angular2html
<input
  type="text"
  id="username"
  class="form-control"
  ngModel
  name="username"
>
```

## Make the form submittable

Use the `(ngSubmit)` directive on the form tag.

```angular2html
<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
```

To get the content in the form that we submit, we need to tag this form as `ngForm` and pass it to the `onSubmit()` 
method.

```angular2html
<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(f)" #f="ngForm">
```

```typescript
onSubmit(form: NgForm) {
    console.log(form);
  }
```

Then, if we open the console, we can see there are many properties in the submitted NgForm Object, including the 
`value`.

## Accessing the Form with @ViewChild

We do not have to pass the `f` in the method. Instead, we can use ViewChild.

```angular2html
<form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()" #f="ngForm">
```

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  @ViewChild('f', { static: false }) signUpForm: NgForm;

  // onSubmit(form: NgForm) {
  //   console.log(form);
  // }

  onSubmit() {
    console.log(this.signUpForm);
  }
}
```

This gives the access to the very same form without passing it to `onSubmit`. 
This is useful if you need to access the form before submit it.

## Input Validation

* We can add a `required` attribute in the input element.

```angular2html
<input
  type="text"
  id="username"
  class="form-control"
  ngModel
  name="username"
  required
>
```

Then when we submit it, we can see in the console that the valid is true only this field is not empty. It tracks this
on a per-control level, as well as the form level.
 
### Additionally, you might also want to enable HTML5 validation (by default, Angular disables it). You can do so by adding the `ngNativeValidate`  to a control in your template.

* We can make the submit button disabled whenever the form is invalid.

```angular2html
<button
  class="btn btn-primary"
  type="submit"
  [disabled]="!f.valid">Submit</button>
```

* We can also take advantage of the form state for CSS style.

```angular2html
input.ng-invalid.ng-touched {
  border: 1px solid red;
}
```

* We can display some message after the invalid inputs.

```angular2html
<input
  type="email"
  id="email"
  class="form-control"
  ngModel
  name="email"
  required
  email
  #email="ngModel"
>
<span class="help-block" *ngIf="!email.valid && email.touched">Please enter a valid email!</span>
```

## Default Values with ngModel

Change `ngModel` to a property binding, and set value for it.

```angular2html
<select
id="secret"
class="form-control"
[ngModel]="defaultQuestion"
name="secret"
>
<option value="pet">Your first Pet?</option>
<option value="teacher">Your first teacher?</option>
</select>
```

```typescript
defaultQuestion = 'pet';
```

## Two-way-binding ngModel

```angular2html
<div class="form-group">
  <textarea
    name="questionAnswer"
    rows="3"
    class="form-control"
    [(ngModel)]="answer"
  ></textarea>
</div>
<p>Your reply: {{ answer }}</p>
```

## Grouping Form Controls with ngModelGroup

```angular2html
<div
  id="user-data"
  ngModelGroup="userData"
  #userData="ngModelGroup">
```
