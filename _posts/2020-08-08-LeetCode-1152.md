## Problem

We are given some website visits: the user with name username[i] visited the website website[i] at time timestamp[i].

A 3-sequence is a list of websites of length 3 sorted in ascending order by the time of their visits.  (The websites in a 3-sequence are not necessarily distinct.)

Find the 3-sequence visited by the largest number of users. If there is more than one solution, return the lexicographically smallest such 3-sequence.

Example 1:
```
Input: username = ["joe","joe","joe","james","james","james","james","mary","mary","mary"], timestamp = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], website = ["home","about","career","home","cart","maps","home","home","about","career"]
Output: ["home","about","career"]
Explanation: 
The tuples in this example are:
["joe", 1, "home"]
["joe", 2, "about"]
["joe", 3, "career"]
["james", 4, "home"]
["james", 5, "cart"]
["james", 6, "maps"]
["james", 7, "home"]
["mary", 8, "home"]
["mary", 9, "about"]
["mary", 10, "career"]
The 3-sequence ("home", "about", "career") was visited at least once by 2 users.
The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "maps") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("home", "cart", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("home", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.
The 3-sequence ("cart", "maps", "home") was visited at least once by 1 user.

                for (int j = i + 1; j < list.size(); j++) {
                    for (int k = j + 1; k < list.size(); k++) {
                        String str = list.get(i).web + " " + list.get(j).web + " " + list.get(k).web;
                        if (!set.contains(str)) {
                            count.put(str, count.getOrDefault(str, 0) + 1);
                            set.add(str);
                        }
                        if (ans.equals("") || count.get(str) > count.get(ans) || count.get(str) == count.get(ans) && str.compareTo(ans) < 0) {
                            ans = str;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return Arrays.asList(ans.split(" "));
    }
