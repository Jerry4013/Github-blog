## Circuit Switching

There are two fundamental approaches to moving data through a network of links and switches: **circuit switching** and **packet switching**.

In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path(buffers, link transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are *reserved* for the duration of the communication session between the end systems.

When the network establishes the circuit, it reserves a constant transmission rate in the network's links. Since a given transmission rate has been reserved for this sender-toreceiver connection, the sender can transfer the data to the receiver at the guaranteed constant rate.

When two hosts want to communicate, the network establishes a dedicated **end-to-end** connection between the two hosts.
