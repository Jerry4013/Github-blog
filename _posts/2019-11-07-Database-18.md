## Multiplicity of Binary E/R Relationships

* If each member of E can be connected by R to at most one member of F, then we say that R is many-one from E to F.

* If R is both many-one from E to F and many-one from F to E, then we say that R is one-one.

* If R is neither many-one from E to F or from F to E, then we say R is many-many.
