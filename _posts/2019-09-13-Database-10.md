## Definition of Third Normal Form

A relation R is in *third normal form* (3NF) if:

* Whenever A1A2...An -> B1B2...Bm is a nontrivial FD, either {A1,A2,...,An} is a superkey, or those of B1,B2,...,Bm that are not among the A's, are each a member of some key (not necessarily the same key).

In other words:

* For each nontrivial FD, either the left side is a superkey, or the right side consists of prime attributes only.

An attribute that is a memeber of some key is often said to be *prime*.

**Algorithm 3.26**: Synthesis of Third-Normal-Form Relations With a Lossless Join and Dependency Preservation.

Method:
1. Find a minimal basis for F, say G.
2. For each functional dependency X -> A in G, use XA as the schema of one of the relaions in the decomposition.
3. If none of the relation schemas from Step 2 is a superkey for R, add another relation whose schema is a key for R.
