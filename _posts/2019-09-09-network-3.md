# The network core

The network core is the mesh of packet switches and links that interconnects the Internet's end systems.

## Packet Switching

End systems exchange messages. A message is sent from a source end system to a destination end system, the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data known as **packets**. Each packet travels through communication links and **packet switches**.

Two types: routers and link-layer switches.
