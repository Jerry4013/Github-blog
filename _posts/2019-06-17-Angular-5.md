### Day 13: 


## Bootstrap: margin between buttons

In normal HTML the browser inserts a 4px gap between all inline and inline-block elements by default.

But there was a change with Angular 6, which now removes these 4px gaps and other whitespace by default in Angular apps.

An option could be to wrap the buttons into a div with the class `btn-toolbar`, gonna let Bootstrap add the desired 
margins in this way.

## Bootstrap: responsive image

In the image element, declare a class `img-responsive` can make Bootstrap adjust the image automatically for us.

## col-xs-12: fill all the width

## Shortcut for creating a class in TypeScript

Instead of define all the attributes and then making a constructor, we can use a simple shortcut.

```typescript
export class Ingredient {
  constructor(public name: string, public amount: number) {}
}
```

## Debugging in Chrome

Go to Sources -> webpack -> . -> go to the source ts code and set breakpoints there.

## Augury debugging tool

This is a chrome extension that allows us to debug our Angular application easily.
