### \#Tip of the Day:

<br /><br />

## OTP Mapping

Redis is perfect in this key value scenario. For now, we use a httpsession temporarily.

## httpServletRequest in Spring

httpServletRequest is managed by Spring container as a threadlocal mode, which
means each request is owned by the current user.

## JQuery tips:

All the rendering must happen after the page is loaded.

## RequestMapping Consumes and produces

In Http request header, ContentType tells the server what type of data it is sending.
Accept tells the server "as a client, I accept what type of data."

In Spring server, consumes maps ContentType and produces maps Accept.

## CORS

```java
@CrossOrigin
public class UserController{}
```
