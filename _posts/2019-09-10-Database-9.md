## Decomposition:

### Recovering Information from a Decomposition

If we do get R back, then we say the decomposition has a *lossless join*.

* If we decompose a relation according to Algorithm 3.20, then the original relation can be recovered exactly by the natural join.

### The Chase Test for Lossless Join

1. The natural join is associative and commutative.
2. Any tuple t in R is surely in π_S1(R) ⨝ π_S2(R) ⨝ ... ⨝ π_Sk(R).
3. π_S1(R) ⨝ π_S2(R) ⨝ ... ⨝ π_Sk(R) = R when the FD's in F hold for R if and only if every tuple in the join is also in R.


| A   | B   | C   | D   |
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| a   | b1  | c1  | d   |
| a   | b2  | c   | d2  |
| a3  | b   | c   | d   |

### Dependency Preservation

We sometimes need to make a tradeoff between preserving dependencies and BNCF.
