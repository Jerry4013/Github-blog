## Install MySql

I install mysql in windows 10. I downloaded the msi file from its website. I installed it as 
a windows service, so it starts with Windows. 

Environment Variable: There is a choice to add mysql in windows system variable when we install
it. Or you can add/check it manually: 

1. Right click the computer icon on the desktop, choose Properties 
2. On the left, choose Advanced system settings, press Environment Variables.
3. Under system variables, double click the `Path` variable. Then add a new line 
with your installation path. The below is my path, you should change to yours.

```
C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
```

## Start MySql service

I tried to use `net start mysql` to start mysql service, but it did not 
work for me. Then I use the Windows UI to check all my service. 

1. Right click the computer icon on the desktop, choose manage.
2. Choose Services on the left side, and I found the MySQL80 is running.

## Login mysql

Because we have provided an environment path for mysql, we can use `mysql` command in any 
directory now. 

Open the command line in Windows, type `mysql -V`. **Notice that here is a Capital V!**
`-V` means we want to check the version of mysql. It should display something like this:

```
mysql  Ver 8.0.15 for Win64 on x86_64 (MySQL Community Server - GPL)
```

Then we can login mysql using the command `mysql -u root -p`, input the password that you
set when you installed mysql. 

![login]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/login.png)

Now, we can start using mysql. If you want to quit, type `exit;` to exit mysql in command line.

## Some frequently-used commands

To show the current user: `SELECT USER();`

To create a database: `CREATE {DATABASE | SCHEMA} db_name`

To display all the databases: `SHOW {DATABASES | SCHEMAS}`

To remove a database: `DROP {DATABASE | SCHEMA} db_name`
