# Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks

## Queuing Delay and Packet Loss

The queuing delay can vary from packet to packet. Typically use statistical measures, such as average queuing delay, variance of queuing delay, and the probability that the queuing delay exceeds some specified value.

The queuing delay depends on the rate at which traffic arrives at the queue, the transmission rate of the link, and the nature of the arriving traffic, that is, whether the traffic arrives periodically or arrives in bursts.

**traffic intensity**: La/R, 每秒进来多少bits，比上每秒发射出去多少bits，就是流量密度。

If La/R > 1, then the average rate at which bits arrive at the queue exceeds the rate at which the bits can be transmitted from the queue.

Design your system so that the traffic intensity is no greater than 1.

If la/R <= 1, the nature of the arriving traffic imacts the queuing delay, that is, periodically,
