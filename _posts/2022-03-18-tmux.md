## Installation and color config

https://infinitelogins.com/2021/03/25/adding-fixing-color-within-tmux-on-ubuntu/

```
sudo apt-get install tmux
or
brew install tmux
```

First, letâ€™s create a bash alias so that launching Tmux will actually launch with color settings configured. Start by editing the following file.

```
vi ~/.bash_aliases
```

Then add the following line.

```
alias tmux="TERM=xterm-256color tmux"
```

Now we will modify our Tmux configuration file as well.
```
vi ~/.tmux.conf
```

And add the following line.
```
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"
```

Then we will restart Tmux.
```
tmux kill-server && tmux
```
