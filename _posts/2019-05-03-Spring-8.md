### \#Tip of the Day: Never explode database object to frontend

<br/><br/>

## Databe design

IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT! IMPORTANT!

Manage passwords with another table. Use encrypted password. Never save password directly in databases.

## MVC Architecture

Never explode UserDO directly to the frontend. UserDO is the object we get from the database.

Three layer Model:

1. First Layer: Data Object. This is mapping with database without any logic.

2. Service Layer: Define a real model used for interaction.

3. View Object: Define a model to explode to frontend.

### Basic concept

Controller depends on Service. 

Service depends on DAO.

DAO is mapped with database.
