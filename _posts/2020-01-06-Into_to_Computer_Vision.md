## real-world applications

* Optical character recognition (OCR)
* Machine inspection
* Retail
* 3D model building (photogrammetry)
* Medical imaging
* Automotive safety
* Match move
* Motion capture (mocap)
* Surveillance
* Fingerprint recognition and biometrics

## Applications in this book:

* Stitching: turning overlapping photos into a single seamlessly stitched panorama
* Exposure bracketing: merging multiple exposures taken under challenging lighting conditions (strong sunlight and shadows) into a single perfectly exposed image
* Morphing: turning a picture of one of your friends into another, using a seamless morph transition
* 3D modeling: converting one or more snapshots into a 3D model of the object or person you are photographing
* Video match move and stabilization: inserting 2D pictures or 3D models into your videos by automatically tracking nearby reference points or using motion estimates to remove shake from your videos
* Photo-based walkthroughs: navigating a large collection of photographs, such as the
interior of your house, by flying between different photos in 3D
* Face detection: for improved camera focusing as well as more relevant image searching
* Visual authentication: automatically logging family members onto your home computer as they sit down in front of the webcam

## three levels of description of a (visual) information processing system

* Computational theory: What is the goal of the computation (task) and what are the constraints that are known or can be brought to bear on the problem?
* Reprsentations and algorithms: How are the input, output, and intermediate information represented and which algorithms are used to calculate the desired result?
* Hardware implementation: How are the representations and algorithms mapped onto actual hardware, e.g., a biological vision system or a specialized piece of silicon? Conversely, how can hardware constraints be used to guide the choice of representation and algorithm? With the increasing use of graphics chips (GPUs) and many-core architectures for computer vision, this question is again becoming quite relevant.
