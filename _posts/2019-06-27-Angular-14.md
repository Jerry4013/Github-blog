### Day 22: Angular Routing

## Passing Static Data to a Route

Previously, we created a page-not-found component and use the star star routing for the 404 errors. What about other 
errors? Next, we will create a common error component called `error-page`.

```
ng g c error-page --skipTests
```

In the template, we want to display some error message via string Interpolation.

```angular2html
<h4>{% raw %}{{ errorMessage }}{% endraw %}</h4>
```

We add a property in this component.

```typescript
errorMessage: string;
```

The problem is, what is the message?

* First, we link our `not-found` path to the new component `ErrorPageComponent`. We pass a static data with the data 
property.

```typescript
// { path: 'not-found', component: PageNotFoundComponent },
  { path: 'not-found', component: ErrorPageComponent, data: {message: 'Page not found!'} },
```

* Inject the `ActivatedRoute` and get the data.

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
    // this.errorMessage = this.route.snapshot.data['message'];
    this.route.data.subscribe(
      (data: Data) => {
        this.errorMessage = data['message'];
      }
    );
  }
```

## Resolving Dynamic Data with the resolve Guard

Now let's take a look at how to fetch some dynamic data before a route is displayed. For example, we need to fetch 
some data from the backend when we click a single item. 

If we have such a use case, we need a `Resolver` service, which will allow us to run some code before a route is 
rendered. The difference to `CanActivate` is the `Resolver` will not decide whether this route should be rendered or 
not and whether the component should be loaded or not. The `Resolver` will always render the component in the end, 
but it will do some pre-loading. It will fetch some data the component will then need later on.

* Create a new file in the `server` component called `server-resolver.service.ts`.

* In this class, we implement `Resolver`

```typescript
interface Server {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  status: string;
}

@Injectable()
export class ServerResolver implements Resolve<Server> {
  constructor(private serversService: ServersService) {}

  resolve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
          state: RouterStateSnapshot):
      Observable<Server> | Promise<Server> | Server {
    return this.serversService.getServer(+route.params['id']);
  }
}
```

Here, we outsource the getServer method. This code will be executed each time when we render a route.

* Add this `ServerResolver` service as a provider in app.module.ts. 

* Add it to our routing module. For example, we want to use it in our `ServerComponent`. Add a `resolve` property.

```typescript
{ path: ':id', component: ServerComponent, resolve: {server: ServerResolver} },
```

This will map the data that this resolver give us back, which it got from the resolve method, because this method 
will be called whenever this route is loaded. So, the data will be stored in this `server` object.

* Binding a property with the `data` Observable

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
    this.route.data
      .subscribe(
        (data: Data) => {
          this.server = data['server'];
        }
      );
    // const id = +this.route.snapshot.params['id'];
    // this.server = this.serversService.getServer(id);
    // this.route.params
    //   .subscribe(
    //     (params: Params) => {
    //       this.server = this.serversService.getServer(+params['id']);
    //     }
    //   );
  }
```

Notice that `data['server']`. This `server` here has to match the name in the routing file that we assigned to the 
resolve property.

This fetching data approach is very important when using asynchronous data.

## Hash Mode Routing

Temporarily, we can use hash routing to make this application work on a real server. Later on, we will use a better way.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes, {useHash: true})
    RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes)
  ],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
```
